## Aviator Game Guide

Aviator is a simple game to play. The goal of the game is to cash out
before the plane flies away. The plane will fly higher and higher, and
the multiplier will increase as it does. The longer you wait to cash
out, the higher the multiplier will be, but the greater the risk that
the plane will fly away before you can cash out.

To start playing Aviator, you need to first place a bet. You can bet any
amount from 1 rupee to 10,000 rupees. Once you have placed your bet, the
plane will take off. You can then cash out at any time by clicking on
the "Cash Out" button.

The multiplier will start at 1x and will increase as the plane flies
higher. The multiplier will continue to increase until the plane flies
away. If you cash out before the plane flies away, you will win your bet
multiplied by the multiplier. If you wait too long to cash out, the
plane will fly away and you will lose your bet.
